# Investigacion
My first Unity game. Made using C# and Ink.


# Have
1. Story branching (via Ink)
2. Case state tracking (determining locations, suspects, and questions available to player)
3. Location switching (background image switch with UI wipe)
4. Some character placement (a few suspect icons and scene placement)


# TODO
1. Finish character icons and placement
2. Implement word bank for input if possible (inkmanager intercepting choices, generating grabbable word bubbles, then interpreting a list of bubble words into a choice selection)


# Nice to Have
1. Implement Suspect Disposition mechanic, whereby suspects reveal more or less info based on their disposition
  1A. Improve suspect disposition by revealing info about the case. Telling certain suspects certain info may cause undiscovered evidence/clues to go missing
2. Implement English Spanish swap mechanic for Players whose primary language is Spanish and whose secondary language is English
3. Implement difficulty settings, determining how much of the game's text is in the Player's primary language vs their secondary language
