# Investigacion
My first Unity game. Made using C# and Ink.


# Have
1. Story branching (via Ink)
2. Case state tracking (determining locations, suspects, and questions available to player)
3. Location switching (background image switch with UI wipe)
4. Some character placement (a few suspect icons and scene placement)
5. Word bank for input (inkmanager intercepts choices, generates grabbable word bubbles, then interprets player generated list of word bubbles into choice selection)


# TODO
1. Finish story failure and success end states
2. Add remaining character icons and placement
3. Add remaining backgrounds


# Nice to Have
1. Implement English Spanish swap mechanic for Players whose primary language is Spanish and whose secondary language is English
2. Implement difficulty settings, determining how much of the game's text is in the Player's primary language vs their secondary language
3. A better story instead of a weird prototype about mummies. Just pretend the text is lorem ipsum.
